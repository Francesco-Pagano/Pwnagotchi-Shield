I made a “shield” using EasyEDA to be able to connect the display, the DS3231 and a GPS (I have a neo 6m). In order to apply it you still need some soldering, but the risk is minimal as the boards are very cheap, thus avoiding to ruin the raspberry. In addition to the materials that are already in the project (raspberry, display, ds3231, gps), only the "long connector" that act as an expansion is needed. Buying the “shields” is very simple: just insert the Gerber file on the site https://jlcpcb.com/ and they will arrive at home in a few days. I insert all the files I made, even the schematic and the circuit, so if someone wants to modify it they can make it smaller or add other sensors. The only flaw is that it gets slightly bulkier, but I have 3D printed a custom case with SolidWorks that can also be modified if desired.
